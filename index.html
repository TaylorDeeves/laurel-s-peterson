                <p>Laurel Peterson's poems are about what binds us to each other, the natural world, and the spiritual world, in language that is both forceful in it's precision and tender in it's rendering: "sewn into your heart is the other end, knotted just under the fragile epicardium. We must both move, so very gently." These poems have a wonderfully wide tonal range.</p>

                            <h2>“Laurel Peterson stands at the ‘edge of the world’ not far from a casually harsh God who enjoys ‘golf afternoons’ as all hell is breaking loose around Him. She puts up with it by writing rings around him, sledgehammer poems wrapped in velvet, poems of confession and affirmation. That’s the Way the Music Sounds is an eclectic array of poems that are fashioned from flesh and reach the ear in quite a new voice to contemporary poetry, a voice as true and lasting as bone.” &ndash;Dan Masterson</h2>

                <p>One eighth grade afternoon, the bully on the bus was worse than usual. I came home and wrote a story of revenge in my journal. What satisfaction to leave her bleeding (on paper, of course!) on the playground. Thus was born my career as a mystery writer.
                <br>   
                <br>
                In college, I majored in psychology, fascinated by what motivates us (or doesn’t). Why did that girl down the hall only write notes to her mother and rarely talk to her? Why did one kid in a family act like a goody two-shoes, while an older brother or sister did drugs and flunked out? Why was the rich girl with all the family connections bulimic? Why did people attend a religious school only to flout all its rules?
                <br>
                <br>
                After college, I tested the waters in advertising, catering, retail, and sales, salting away character details in my journals, and in lousy short stories. Then, I did an MFA and entered the world of academic politics, where I currently reside, writing poetry and mysteries, and grading papers.</p>
